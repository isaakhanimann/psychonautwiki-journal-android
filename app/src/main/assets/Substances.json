Blood pressure and pulse increase, pupils dilate. Detachment of the body from the mind and ego dissolution are common, near-death experiences also occur relatively often, especially when high doses are consumed. The perception of time changes greatly during intoxication. A few minutes can be perceived as very long and intense. In addition, different feelings such as fear, euphoria, etc. can be experienced within a short period of time. Consumers report immersion in very \"bizarre\" worlds in which connections between being, environment and matter arise. Physical perception can also be influenced, in that one feels weightless or thinks one is falling.\nWith 5-MeO-DMT, the potential effect is greater, but less optical than with DMT.","dosageRemark":"MeO-DMT must be dosed very carefully, as even a few milligrams more can cause a very intense and unpleasant effect, which can result in psychological and mental problems lasting several weeks.","generalRisks":"The risk associated with the use of 5-MeO-DMT is mainly psychological and depends on the personality structure of the user. The perceptual changes during a trip can be so intense that especially inexperienced users feel overwhelmed by the flood of impressions. The perception of sudden emotional outbursts can also be perceived as rather disturbing and overwhelming. At high doses, such psychological side effects can be felt for days to weeks. If the rules of the set and setting are not followed, there can be false reactions, loss of orientation, panic, paranoia and horror trips. Physical side effects include nausea, vomiting, increase in heart rate, slightly accelerated breathing, increased blood pressure, pupil dilation, increased salivation, tremors, restlessness, headaches and movement disorders.","longtermRisks":"Permanent disturbances in self- and reality recognition are possible. The view of the world can be permanently called into question, which can make it difficult to cope with everyday life. Latent (hidden) psychoses can be triggered.","saferUse":["Only consume when you feel good. If you are afraid of the strong effects, do not use. Do not use if you are afraid of the substance.","Do not use 5-MeO-DMT alone!

If there is no effect, increase the dose the next time. Do not add more on the same day.","The consumption of MAO-inhibiting foods such as matured cheese, smoked fish or meat, sauerkraut, tofu, chocolate etc. should be avoided before and after consumption.","People with high blood pressure should not consume 5-MeO-DMT.","A trip with 5-MeO-DMT should remain an exceptional experience.

Caution with chronic use! A thujone overdose manifests itself in seizures and epilepsy-like symptoms.","dosageRemark":"Standard drinks such as 3 dl beer, 1 dl wine or 2 cl spirits contain about 12 g alcohol. The effect of alcohol is influenced by the amount consumed, the type of alcohol (sugary and/or carbonated), the period of consumption and individual factors (age, sex, weight). The blood alcohol concentration is measured in parts per thousand (‰). The higher the alcohol concentration in the blood, the stronger the effect of alcohol.","generalRisks":"Small amounts of alcohol generally have a relaxing and exhilarating effect, a general feeling of well-being spreads, fears are reduced and sociability increases. The consumption of larger amounts can lead to balance and speech disorders, visual disturbances (double vision or tunnel vision), stomach pain, nausea to vomiting, headaches (hangover) due to dehydration, loss of control and blackouts. There is a risk of accidents due to overestimation of one's own abilities and reduced ability to react. High doses can lead to hypothermia or overheating, deep sleep and coma. Very high doses (blood alcohol concentration of 3-4‰) can be life-threatening.\nBinge drinking, i.e. the consumption of a large amount of alcohol in a very short time, causes the blood alcohol content to rise particularly quickly and strongly. This can quickly lead to alcohol poisoning. Consequences can be: comatose state, memory lapses (film tears), deactivation of important reflexes (danger of choking when vomiting, danger of freezing to death when cold) as well as epileptic seizures. There is also an increased risk of thrombosis, high or low blood pressure, respiratory depression and sudden cardiac death.","longtermRisks":"Since alcohol is a cytotoxin, regular heavy consumption can have consequences such as damage to all bodily organs, deficiency symptoms, disorders of the nervous system, coordination of movement and memory functions, and even alcohol-induced dementia. Alcohol is a co-carcinogen, i.e. it significantly increases the carcinogenic effect of other substances (e.g. nicotine).\nAlcohol can produce a dependence with psychological and physical symptoms. Typical withdrawal symptoms are trembling, sweating, nausea and vomiting up to epileptic seizures. On a psychological level, irritability, anxiety disorders, depressive moods and hallucinations may occur.

At high doses: slowing down, drowsiness, danger of memory lapses (\"film tear\").\nTaking benzodiazepines increases the effectiveness of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor. This triggers sedative (calming), hypnotic, anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving), anticonvulsant (anticonvulsant) and muscle-relaxing effects in the body. Benzodiazepines have a depressant effect on the central nervous system. The flow of information in the brain between the brain cells (neurons) is thereby reduced / disturbed and feelings and perceptions are dampened.\nThe breakdown of the individual active ingredients of benzodiazepines in the body is age-dependent and therefore varies from person to person.","generalRisks":"There is little information available on risks, toxicity, side effects and long-term consequences. Therefore, the general information on benzodiazepines applies:\nWhen mixing with other downers (alcohol, GHB/GBL, heroin) there is a risk of respiratory paralysis!\nTaking benzodiazepines can cause numerous undesirable side effects. In addition, regular and long-term use carries a very high risk of physical and psychological dependence. Benzodiazepines should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor and only for a short period of time (max. 4-6 weeks). Longer-term use should be discussed with the treating specialist. The dosages and duration of action of the individual benzodiazepines differ considerably.\nSide effects of benzodiazepines may be as follows: Prolonged fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, impaired reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, dizziness, motor difficulties, visual disturbances, slowed breathing, muscle weakness, confusion, sexual dysfunction, aggression, outbursts of anger, restlessness, random movements, allergies, skin problems/rashes and speech and movement disorders. Some benzodiazepines can cause seizures in epileptics.","longtermRisks":"Regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence (very high dependence potential). Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms (including dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression).\nIn addition, seizures and memory disorders/loss and listlessness (hangover effects) can occur. In case of possible dependence, withdrawal should be discussed with a doctor beforehand and the withdrawal should be medically accompanied.

At high doses: hallucinations, circulatory failure, strokes as well as kidney, liver and heart failure and states of deep unconsciousness. An often underestimated danger is the rise in body temperature, which can lead to dehydration of the body. In high doses, acute amphetamine psychosis can occur. Signs of this are hallucinations in the form of colour spots and with features of schizophrenia. The risk of such an acute mental disorder increases with consumption over several days and/or if high doses are taken and food intake and sleep are neglected over a longer period of time. Such an experience usually normalises after sufficient sleep. During and after coming down: extreme need for sleep, exhaustion, strong feeling of hunger,depressive mood, irritability, etc.","longtermRisks":"There is a risk of addiction with psychological symptoms, especially if the use takes on a (performance-enhancing) function in everyday life (e.g. at work) or physical/psychological exhaustion is combated with amphetamine. Frequent use of amphetamine not infrequently leads to physical deficiency symptoms (e.g. calcium deficiency, which can lead to bone and tooth problems) and to psychological problems such as dejection or listlessness. Regular and high-dose use can lead to constant restlessness (but also persistent fatigue), sleep and circulatory disorders as well as anxiety disorders up to persistent amphetamine psychosis with paranoid delusions. In addition, high blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, weight loss, skin inflammations (\"speed pimples\"), stomach problems as well as liver and kidney damage and cramps are possible.

CBD also has analgesic, sedative and narcotic effects.\nThe main cannabis active substances THC and CBD dock in the body to the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. This activates the body's own messenger substance endocannabinoid. This has a relaxing, appetite-stimulating, calming and pain-relieving effect. Feelings are intensified, serenity and/or groundless cheerfulness set in. The experience of time is changed, usually slowed down. In high doses and CBD-free varieties, cannabis can have hallucinogenic effects. Since it is usually consumed together with tobacco, the joint-typical effect is an interaction between cannabis and tobacco. This usually leads to an intensification and prolongation of the effect, as tobacco inhibits the degradation of endocannabinoids. ","dosageRemark":"The main active ingredient content and the ratio of THC to CBD differ greatly depending on the product. Therefore, the dosage is difficult to determine. Hashish contains on average more THC and mostly CBD. Outdoor weed varieties contain less THC and less CBD, while indoor weed varieties contain mainly THC and rarely CBD.\nCYP2C9 genotype affects THC sensitivity significantly: Subjects with the *3/*3 genotype had 3-fold higher THC levels in their blood than subjects with the *1/*1 genotype.

At high doses and varieties with little CBD, circulatory problems up to circulatory collapse, in the worst case paranoia and depressive moods may occur.\nWhen consuming cannabis products, the dosage is more difficult to estimate, making the risks and side effects more unpredictable.","longtermRisks":"With frequent and regular use, there is a risk of psychological dependence. Symptoms of mild physical dependence may also manifest themselves; in the case of sudden abstinence, sweating, hot/cold shivers, loss of appetite and difficulty falling asleep as well as irritability are possible. In the case of chronic use, there is a danger of loss of reality; latent psychoses can be triggered. In addition, long-term impairment of short-term memory and the ability to motivate oneself is possible.\nSmoking, especially when mixed with tobacco, increases susceptibility to respiratory problems (bronchitis, tracheitis, pneumonia, etc.) when consumed chronically.

This triggers sedative (calming), hypnotic, anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving), anticonvulsant (anticonvulsant) and muscle-relaxing effects in the body. Benzodiazepines have a depressant effect on the central nervous system. The flow of information in the brain between the brain cells (neurons) is thereby reduced / disturbed and feelings and perceptions are dampened.\nThe breakdown of the individual active ingredients of benzodiazepines in the body is age-dependent and therefore varies from person to person.","generalRisks":"There is little information available on risks, toxicity, side effects and long-term consequences. Therefore, the general information on benzodiazepines applies:\nWhen mixing with other downers (alcohol, GHB/GBL, heroin) there is a risk of respiratory paralysis!\nTaking benzodiazepines can cause numerous undesirable side effects. In addition, regular and long-term use carries a very high risk of physical and psychological dependence. Benzodiazepines should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor and only for a short period of time (max. 4-6 weeks). Longer-term use should be discussed with the treating specialist. The dosages and duration of action of the individual benzodiazepines differ considerably.\nSide effects of benzodiazepines may be as follows: Prolonged fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, impaired reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, dizziness, motor difficulties, visual disturbances, slowed breathing, muscle weakness, confusion, sexual dysfunction, aggression, outbursts of anger, restlessness, random movements, allergies, skin problems/rashes and speech and movement disorders. Some benzodiazepines can cause seizures in epileptics.","longtermRisks":"Regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence (very high dependence potential). Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms (including dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression).\nIn addition, seizures and memory disorders/loss and listlessness (hangover effects) can occur. In case of possible dependence, withdrawal should be discussed with a doctor beforehand and the withdrawal should be medically accompanied. It is extremely important that the dose is reduced gradually.","saferUse":["If medicines are obtained on the black market or on the internet and not from a pharmacy/medical facility, the contents are unclear.

Blood pressure and pulse increase, pupils dilate. Detachment of the body from the mind and ego dissolution are common, near-death experiences also occur relatively often, especially when high doses are consumed. The perception of time changes greatly during intoxication. A few minutes can be perceived as very long and intense. In addition, different feelings such as fear, euphoria, etc. can be experienced within a short period of time. Consumers report immersion in very \"bizarre\" worlds in which connections between being, environment and matter arise. With DMT, this phenomenon is also visually pronounced, i.e., images are linked with oneself, matter and being in one's own society. Physical perception can also be influenced, in that one feels weightless or thinks one is falling.\nWhen swallowed, DMT is only effective in combination with MAO inhibitors. MAO inhibitors (e.g. harmine) are substances and drugs that prevent the enzyme MAO from breaking down the body's own messenger substances such as adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin etc. as well as foreign alkaloids such as caffeine, cocaine, morphine. The psychoactive potion ayahuasca and changa are such a combination. After the consumption of MAO inhibitors, the consumption of certain everyday foods such as cheese is life-threatening.","dosageRemark":"Ayahuasca is a shamanic herbal potion made from DMT-containing chacruna leaves (Psychotria viridis) and the harmaline-containing ayahuasca liana Banisteriopsis caapi. Harmaline is an MAO inhibitor. MAO inhibitors are substances and drugs that prevent the enzyme MAO from breaking down the body's own messenger substances such as adrenalin, dopamine, serotonin, etc. as well as foreign alkaloids such as caffeine, cocaine, etc.. MAO normally also degrades the active substance DMT even before it can enter the central nervous system via the blood-brain barrier.\nChanga is a mixture for smoking of DMT-containing plants (but usually mostly crystalline DMT) and herbs that act as MAO inhibitors.","generalRisks":"The risk associated with the use of DMT is mainly psychological and depends on the personality structure of the user. The perceptual changes during a trip can be so intense that especially inexperienced users feel overwhelmed by the flood of impressions. The perception of sudden emotional outbursts can also be perceived as rather disturbing and overwhelming. At high doses, such psychological side effects can be felt for days to weeks. If the rules of the set and setting are not followed, there can be false reactions, loss of orientation, panic, paranoia and horror trips. Physical side effects include nausea, vomiting, increase in heart rate, slightly accelerated breathing, increased blood pressure, pupil dilation, increased salivation, tremors, restlessness, headaches and movement disorders.","longtermRisks":"Permanent disturbances in self- and reality recognition are possible. The view of the world can be permanently called into question, which can make it difficult to cope with everyday life. Latent (hidden) psychoses can be triggered.","saferUse":["Only consume when you feel good. If you are afraid of the strong effects, do not use. Do not use if you are afraid of the substance.","Do not use DMT alone! Take it in a safe atmosphere and together with experienced people you trust.","Take DMT while sitting or lying down, as physical perception and ability to move are impaired during intoxication.","Dose carefully at first.

This triggers sedative (calming), hypnotic, anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving), anticonvulsant (anticonvulsant) and muscle-relaxing effects in the body. Benzodiazepines have a depressant effect on the central nervous system. The flow of information in the brain between the brain cells (neurons) is thereby reduced / disturbed and feelings and perceptions are dampened.\nThe breakdown of the individual active ingredients of benzodiazepines in the body is age-dependent and therefore varies from person to person.","generalRisks":"There is little information available on risks, toxicity, side effects and long-term consequences. Therefore, the general information on benzodiazepines applies:\nWhen mixing with other downers (alcohol, GHB/GBL, heroin) there is a risk of respiratory paralysis!\nTaking benzodiazepines can cause numerous undesirable side effects. In addition, regular and long-term use carries a very high risk of physical and psychological dependence. Benzodiazepines should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor and only for a short period of time (max. 4-6 weeks). Longer-term use should be discussed with the treating specialist. The dosages and duration of action of the individual benzodiazepines differ considerably.\nSide effects of benzodiazepines may be as follows: Prolonged fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, impaired reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, dizziness, motor difficulties, visual disturbances, slowed breathing, muscle weakness, confusion, sexual dysfunction, aggression, outbursts of anger, restlessness, random movements, allergies, skin problems/rashes and speech and movement disorders. Some benzodiazepines can cause seizures in epileptics.","longtermRisks":"Regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence (very high dependence potential). Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms (including dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression).\nIn addition, seizures and memory disorders/loss and listlessness (hangover effects) can occur. In case of possible dependence, withdrawal should be discussed with a doctor beforehand and the withdrawal should be medically accompanied.

Has been strongly linked to cognitive decline in excess. Popular at parties, it is often sold in powder or in pills, and may be adulterated with other similar chemicals.","effectsSummary":"MDMA mainly causes an increased release of the body's own messenger substance serotonin. At the recommended dosage, about 80% of the available serotonin at that time is released. This release triggers a feeling of euphoria, lightness and light-heartedness. Sight and hearing change, touch and music are felt more intensely, inhibitions are reduced and the need for contact is increased. The effect is described as empathogenic (triggering a feeling of closeness and connection to other people) and entactogenic (touching the inner self, intensifying emotional perception). The simultaneous release of the neurotransmitters noradrenalin and dopamine has a stimulating effect. This reduces the feeling of hunger and thirst as well as tiredness and increases alertness. Body temperature and blood pressure also rise.","dosageRemark":"Swallowed max. 1.5 mg MDMA per kg body weight for men, max. 1.3 mg per kg body weight for women. Lower doses are recommended for rectal and nasal use.","generalRisks":"Side effects are jaw spasms, muscle tremors, urinary retention, headache, nausea/vomiting, increased pulse and blood pressure. The heart, liver and kidneys are particularly stressed. There is also a risk of life-threatening overheating as body temperature rises and the body becomes dehydrated. In the case of an overdose, hallucinations are possible. When the effect wears off or on the days afterwards, depressive moods may occur.","longtermRisks":"After a consumption experience, the body needs at least 4 weeks to regenerate the serotonin balance. If one does not allow oneself this break in the long term and consumes repeatedly after short breaks, the probability of a permanent restriction of spatial awareness increases. This risk also exists after repeated high doses. Intense and prolonged use of ecstasy can also lead to a change in the serotonin system. A form of dependence with psychological symptoms can develop, especially if ecstasy use is linked to a certain activity, for example if it is always used at parties and partying without ecstasy afterwards is no longer possible. In the case of snorting, the nasal mucous membranes and the nasal wall are damaged. Rectal use can cause irritation in the rectum.","saferUse":["If you want to be sure that your pill really contains MDMA and know the dose, use drug checking. If this is not possible, first consume only one third of the pill.","Do not add more right away, but wait two hours for the full effect and then decide.","Avoid mixed use with other substances.","Avoid alcohol and drink enough non-alcoholic beverages. Approx. 3 dl per hour is enough. Isotonic drinks are best to avoid hyponatremia (\"water intoxication\").","Take breaks from dancing at parties and get some fresh air.","Do not wear headgear, except in strong sun (danger of overheating!).","Do not take ecstasy immediately after a meal, but also not on an empty stomach. It is advisable to have a light, healthy meal a few hours before.","Accept when the effect runs out. \"Re-spiking\" increases the toxicity (poisonousness) of MDMA.","Give yourself time to recover and take regular breaks (at least 4-6 weeks) to restore serotonin levels.","If you use MDMA nasally, follow the safe-sniffing rules. If consuming rectally, use lubricant to minimise the risk of rectal irritation.","If you are taking medication, ask your doctor about possible interactions. If you are taking psychotropic drugs, the use of MDMA is strongly discouraged (risk of serotonin syndrome)!","Ecstasy can cause asthma attacks in asthmatics and epileptic seizures in epileptics.","People with high blood pressure, heart problems, hyperthyroidism, liver and kidney diseases or circulatory problems should refrain from using MDMA.","There is a small percentage of people, who due to their race and family history, have a lower level of the liver enzyme P450 2D6.

At higher doses, it can induce mania, psychosis and muscle degeneration among other issues. Tolerant users may report much higher doses than new users.","effectsSummary":"The body's own performance drug noradrenaline is released, the simultaneous release of dopamine increases self-esteem. Since methamphetamine reaches the brain more quickly than amphetamine and the stimulating effect is stronger, it causes a stronger high and has a higher addiction potential than amphetamine. The body temperature rises, pulse and breathing are accelerated, blood pressure is increased. Hunger and the need for sleep are suppressed. The willingness to take risks is increased, the sensation of pain is suppressed, and euphoria, extreme nervousness, and an increased urge to talk (\"babble flash\") can occur. Methamphetamine has a pleasure-increasing and disinhibiting effect, which is why it is also used as a sex drug.","generalRisks":"Methamphetamine can sometimes hardly be distinguished from amphetamine, but has a much stronger effect.

Constant restlessness, sleep and circulatory disorders, paranoia and even amphetamine psychosis can occur. Weight loss, skin inflammations (\"speed pimples\"), tooth loss, stomach problems and cramps are also possible. In menstruating persons, the menstrual cycle may be disturbed. Snorting damages the nasal mucous membranes and nasal septum, swallowing damages the stomach mucous membranes. Chronic consumption favours brain haemorrhages and strokes with sudden paralysis.

When prescribed for ADHD, the drug is supposed to act as a filter for incoming stimuli and alleviate symptoms such as distractibility, attention deficit disorder, disorganisation and impulsivity.\nHowever, due to its stimulating, energising and drive-enhancing properties, methylphenidate is also used as a party drug or to increase performance. Due to the increased release of dopamine, similar effects occur as with the use of cocaine.","generalRisks":"If prescribed by a doctor or used as directed, sleep disturbances and irritability can often occur. Eating disorders, stomach complaints, nausea and vomiting are also known side effects.\nAbusive use and higher doses can lead to seizures, cardiac arrhythmias as well as headaches and confusion.\nTolerance develops relatively quickly, which is why higher and higher doses have to be consumed. In overdose, Ritalin can trigger hallucinations.","longtermRisks":"It is assumed that no dependence develops with therapeutic use of Ritalin. When abusing higher doses over a longer period of time, psychological dependence may develop. With abrupt discontinuation, withdrawal symptoms such as lethargy, apathy, depression and paranoia may occur.","saferUse":["If possible, do not consume methylphenidate intravenously.

This triggers sedative (calming), hypnotic, anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving), anticonvulsant (anticonvulsant) and muscle-relaxing effects in the body. Benzodiazepines have a depressant effect on the central nervous system.

Therefore, the general information on benzodiazepines applies:\nWhen mixing with other downers (alcohol, GHB/GBL, heroin) there is a risk of respiratory paralysis!\nTaking benzodiazepines can cause numerous undesirable side effects. In addition, regular and long-term use carries a very high risk of physical and psychological dependence. Benzodiazepines should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor and only for a short period of time (max. 4-6 weeks). Longer-term use should be discussed with the treating specialist. The dosages and duration of action of the individual benzodiazepines differ considerably.\nSide effects of benzodiazepines may be as follows: Prolonged fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, impaired reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, dizziness, motor difficulties, visual disturbances, slowed breathing, muscle weakness, confusion, sexual dysfunction, aggression, outbursts of anger, restlessness, random movements, allergies, skin problems/rashes and speech and movement disorders. Some benzodiazepines can cause seizures in epileptics.","longtermRisks":"Regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence (very high dependence potential). Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms (including dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression).\nIn addition, seizures and memory disorders/loss and listlessness (hangover effects) can occur.

Also prescribed for daytime sleeping disorders.","effectsSummary":"The mechanism of action of modafinil is not yet fully understood. It is assumed that modafinil binds to the dopamine transporter and inhibits dopamine reuptake. Unlike other stimulants such as amphetamine or methylphenidate (Ritalin®, Concerta®), which in equivalent wakefulness-promoting doses increase neuronal activity throughout the brain, modafinil acts primarily on the brain regions responsible for controlling waking, sleep, wakefulness and vigilance (sustained attention).\nModafinil thus promotes alertness (physical and mental), increases attention and motor activity. Due to its stimulating, wakefulness-promoting properties, modafinil is consumed by healthy people as a so-called \"smart drug\" or \"cognitive enhancer\".According to user reports, modafinil has a much more subtle effect than other stimulants and does not trigger comparable states of intoxication. Modafinil causes less physical restlessness and the sleep-wake rhythm is less disturbed.\nA mood-lifting and euphoric effect is controversial. According to a publication of the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), modafinil causes psychoactive and euphoric effects, whereas various studies point to the lack of a euphoric effect.","dosageRemark":"The recommended daily dose when prescribed by a doctor is 200 mg at the beginning. If there is an insufficient response to this dose, a maximum daily dose of 400 mg may be administered/taken.\nThe long-term effect of modafinil when taken regularly and over a longer period of time has not yet been studied. If taken over a longer period of time, regular monitoring by a medical specialist is therefore recommended.","generalRisks":"In 2011, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended limiting the marketing authorisation for modafinil to the treatment of adults with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Due to the possible risks and side effects, modafinil has since not been approved for other indications, for the treatment of children and adolescents, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\nThe following side effects may occur: Headache, nervousness, palpitations, abdominal pain and/or dry mouth. In addition, modafinil can impair the effectiveness of oral contraceptives! Therefore, the use of additional contraceptive methods is recommended during intake. Further risks are cardiovascular diseases such as cardiac arrhythmias, diseases of the heart muscles, cardiac insufficiency and/or high blood pressure. Furthermore, the consumption of modafinil can have an effect on the psyche and trigger hostility, aggression ,psychoses/psychotic disorders, depression, insomnia, up to delusions and/or anxiety.\nSymptoms of overdose with modafinil alone or in combination with other medicines: Insomnia; central nervous symptoms (restlessness, disorientation, confusion, agitation, hallucinations); nausea, diarrhoea; palpitations, high blood pressure, chest pain, slow heartbeat.","longtermRisks":"Since modafinil affects the dopamine balance in the brain, among other things, there is an increased potential for physical dependence. If modafinil is consumed for the purpose of performance enhancement and promotion of alertness with the intention of being able to achieve high performance with little sleep, there is also a risk of psychological dependence.\nThe long-term effect of modafinil when taken regularly and over a longer period of time has been little studied so far. If taken over a longer period of time, regular monitoring by a medical specialist is therefore recommended.","saferUse":["Caution: The effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be impaired by the simultaneous intake of modafinil.","Side effects such as blurred vision and dizziness may impair the ability to drive or operate machinery.","Taking modafinil is not a substitute for sleep! Be sure to maintain good sleep hygiene.","If you are using modafinil for cognitive enhancement, try to think of alternative strategies to improve your memory and recall.

On the psychological level, confusion, nightmares and hallucinations may occur. Rather rarely, there is a drop in blood pressure, breathing difficulties and allergic reactions.\nOverdoses with morphine are life-threatening, as the substance has a strong respiratory depressant effect (worsening breathing) even in low doses, which can lead to respiratory arrest and coma. Oral consumption of 0.3 - 1.5 g and intravenous consumption of 100 mg can lead to a fatal overdose. In opioid addicts, the lethal dose can be significantly higher.

This triggers sedative (calming), hypnotic, anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving), anticonvulsant (anticonvulsant) and muscle-relaxing effects in the body. Benzodiazepines have a depressant effect on the central nervous system. The flow of information in the brain between the brain cells (neurons) is thereby reduced / disturbed and feelings and perceptions are dampened.\nThe breakdown of the individual active ingredients of benzodiazepines in the body is age-dependent and therefore varies from person to person.","generalRisks":"There is little information available on risks, toxicity, side effects and long-term consequences. Therefore, the general information on benzodiazepines applies:\nWhen mixing with other downers (alcohol, GHB/GBL, heroin) there is a risk of respiratory paralysis!\nTaking benzodiazepines can cause numerous undesirable side effects. In addition, regular and long-term use carries a very high risk of physical and psychological dependence. Benzodiazepines should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor and only for a short period of time (max. 4-6 weeks). Longer-term use should be discussed with the treating specialist. The dosages and duration of action of the individual benzodiazepines differ considerably.\nSide effects of benzodiazepines may be as follows: Prolonged fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, impaired reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, dizziness, motor difficulties, visual disturbances, slowed breathing, muscle weakness, confusion, sexual dysfunction, aggression, outbursts of anger, restlessness, random movements, allergies, skin problems/rashes and speech and movement disorders. Some benzodiazepines can cause seizures in epileptics.","longtermRisks":"Regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence (very high dependence potential). Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms (including dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression).\nIn addition, seizures and memory disorders/loss and listlessness (hangover effects) can occur. In case of possible dependence, withdrawal should be discussed with a doctor beforehand and the withdrawal should be medically accompanied. It is extremely important that the dose is reduced gradually.","saferUse":["If medicines are obtained on the black market or on the internet and not from a pharmacy/medical facility, the contents are unclear.

In women, menstruation may also be absent.\nOther opioid-typical side effects such as hallucinations, confusion, vomiting and nausea are less common with oxycodone.\nOverdoses with oxycodone are life-threatening, as the substance has a strong respiratory depressant effect even in low doses when abused, which can lead to respiratory arrest and coma. For opioid addicts, the lethal dose can be much higher. An overdose is treated by taking naloxone, an opioid antagonist.","longtermRisks":"The consumption of oxycodone leads to physical and psychological dependence after a short time, even more quickly than with morphine.

The endogenous substance endorphin ensures that pain messages are sent to the human brain in a reduced form by docking to certain receptors in the human body. The active ingredient tramadol has a similar mode of action in that the active ingredient attaches to neurotransmitter docking sites (opioid receptors) and transmits a signal to the brain, which subsequently triggers pain relief. In addition, tramadol inhibits the reuptake of certain nerve messengers (noradrenaline and serotonin), which in turn increases the amount of free messengers in the tissue and supports the analgesic effect.","dosageRemark":"When consuming for the first time, low doses should be used, as the risk of respiratory arrest is increased.","generalRisks":"Adverse side effects may include: headache, malaise/nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, drowsiness, circulatory problems (palpitations, fainting spells, etc.).\nIn higher doses, seizures, speech disorders, paraesthesias (unpleasant bodily sensations, e.g. parts of the body falling asleep), tremor (muscle tremor), coordination disorders and circulatory collapse may occur. Hallucinations, confusion, delirium, anxiety, sleep disorders and nightmares can also be triggered.","longtermRisks":"Tramadol has a low dependence potential with moderate use. However, regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence. Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms, which may manifest as dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression.\nProlonged use can lead to general mood changes, changes in decision-making behaviour or perceptual and reaction disorders.","saferUse":["Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.","Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.","If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.","Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids.
