Then ingestions of different substances and roas will always take the full height of the timeline.\n                                    \n                                    If this setting is disabled then timelines of different substances have a height relative to each other. In that case the average of the common dose is used as the point to compare it to.\n                                    E.g. if the oral average common dose of MDMA is 100mg and the average common dose of insufflated MDMA is 50mg then the timeline for 100mg of oral MDMA is the same height as for 50mg of insufflated MDMA.\n                                    This is also applied across substances. E.g. if the common dose of oral 2C-B is 20mg then the timeline of 40mg oral 2C-B will be twice as high as 100mg of oral MDMA.\n                                "</string>

    <string name="_3_dosage_content">Know your dose, start small and wait. A full stomach can delay the onset of a swallowed ingestion by hours. A dose that\'s easy for somebody with a tolerance might be too much for you.\n\nInvest in a milligram scale so you can accurately weigh your dosages. Bear in mind that milligram scales under %1$c1000 cannot accurately weigh out doses below 50 mg and are highly inaccurate under 10 - 15 mg. If the amounts of the drug are smaller, use volumetric dosing (dissolving in water or alcohol to make it easier to measure).\n\nMany substances do not have linear dose-response curves, meaning that doubling the dose amount will cause a greater than double increase (and rapidly result in overwhelming, unpleasant, and potentially dangerous experiences), therefore doses should only be adjusted upward with slight increases (e.g. 1/4 to 1/2 of the previous dose).</string>

Choose an environment that provides a sense of safety, familiarity, control, and comfort.
